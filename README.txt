                        CXPhasing

  What is it?
  -----------

 CXPhasing is an analysis code for reconstructing ptychographic coherent
 diffractive imaging data. The goal of the project is to provide a complete
 solution from raw data to reconstructed image without input from the 
 user beyond specifying some initial parameters. CXPhasing is not intended
 to be the fastest phase retrieval code. Instead, it tries to be easily
 understood, easily extensible and able to work without human intervention.
