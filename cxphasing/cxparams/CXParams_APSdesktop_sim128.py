IO

Parameters describing interaction with the filesystem.

Inputs
------
scan_id: a unique string used to create an outout folder for reconstructions

base_dir: an optinal string that will be prepended to identify data locations

code_dir: a copy of the source code is zipped and saved with each reconstruction.

log_dir: specifies the logfile directory

mda_file: location of mda_file

data_filename: a string describing the pattern to identify data frames.
               The pattern specifies how the data should merged and includes 
               repeated acquisitions and multiple exposure times.
               Single exposure time:
                  Two patterns can be used:
                    (a) data_filename = 'image_{0:06d}.h5'
                    (b) data_filename = 'image_{0:06d}_{0:05d}.h5'
                  In (b) it is assumed that the final number field represents
                  repeated acquisitions.
                Multiple exposure times and acqisitions (per position):
                  Only one pattern can be used:
                  (c) data_filename = 'image_{0:06d}_{0:05d}_{exp time in msec}.h5'

data_filename_range: a list with an entry for each variable defined in data_filename.
                        e.g data_filename_range = [0,199] means image_00000.h5 to image_00199.h5

Measurement

Time taken for reconstruction depends critically on whether to perform subpixel shifting.
If the ptycho scan mesh positions are integers then no subpixel shifting is performed. If
they are not integers the algorithm will use an FFT based shifting function which pads the
array size to the next power of 2. This is computationally expensive to do and dramatically
slows down the time to analyse the data.

ptycho_subpixel_shift: describes whether to allow subpixel shifting. In practice, this
                       has the effect of rounding the scan_mesh values to the nearest

Preprocessing

This section defines how raw data is turned into processed data.

shift_data - a shift applied to all images in a stack
threshhold_raw_data - threshholds and rebases all images in stack


Choosing an ROI/Padding & Cropping data:

Changing the array size can be done by entering the pixel values corresponding to
qx=0 & qy=0 and then specifying the desired array size. The array will then be selected
symmetrically around the qx, qy position. If padding is necessary the padded values
will be zero.

qx0qy0 -             the xy coords (pixels) that define the qx=0, qy=0 in the detector
                     plane.
desired_array_size - desired array size in pixels. Setting to None will result in 
                     no changes made to the array size. The array will be cropped
                     to a square and preferably even sized.
bin -                 specify the binning factor

saturation_level -   detector pixels >= this value are assumed to be saturated when merging mutliple-
                     exposure-time acquisitions into a single diffraction pattern. Saturated pixels 
                     are set to zero as if they weren't measured.
                     Value below zero will skip any saturartion correction.
